			    Lsof Binaries

I do not recommend that you use a pre-compiled lsof binary and I no
longer provide any.

It is important that you compile lsof for yourself from the distributed
sources to allow its Configure script to tailor the binary to your
system.

    *************************************************************
    * DON'T TRY TO USE AN LSOF BINARY, COMPILED FOR ONE UNIX OS *
    * VERSION, ON ANOTHER.                                      *
    *************************************************************

On some UNIX dialects lsof versions may be even more restricted by
architecture types.

    *************************************************************
    * AVOID USING BINARIES FOR LSOF REVISIONS BELOW 4.63.  THEY *
    * ARE VULNERABLE TO THE STANDARD I/O DESCRIPTOR ATTACK.     *
    * (See 00FAQ for more information.)                         *
